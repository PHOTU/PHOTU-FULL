                                    the incredible editing suites that vary from Sony Vegas to Premire Pro.
                                    So basically all I want to do is make people laugh and there is nothing better than a comment which shows their enjoyment. I mean it's this whole seperate world that you can escape
                                    to when you're down in real life you have all this support in one place. I'm going to buy the Canon G7x, most youtubers use this camera and for a good reason too, this camera has a (20.3MP, 4.2x Zoom)
                                    which is very beefy for a camera of this size it shoots crisp perfect quality as well as having a touch
                                    to focus feature on the touch screen display wich can be flipped up to be used for vlogging too! Really awesome camera all around can be used for any purpose but is more popular for vloggers!</p>

                                    This may sound blunt but you need the best quality you can afford, as no one truly wants to watch a video flimed on a potato. But seriously when was
                                    last time you saw a bad quality video by someone with loads of subscribers, it is important that your message is clear with both video and audio.
                                    Personally I use Vegas Pro, there is a free version and I find it very easy to use. You may use Movie Maker to start, but for more advaced tasks like Face Cam and just more professional editing use this.

                                    You have to ignore the people who want you to fail or take the mick, these are toxic freinds and negative people don't let the haters stop you from doing your thing.
